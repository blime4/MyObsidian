## Introduction: Dennis Johnson

> 📌 he was nothing if not candid and open, often self-critical, and always intelligent and witty. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 18:26:07 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-2838-2931

> 📌 even to such intense public scrutiny … yet felt it was also incumbent upon him to protect the mystery inherent in any art-making career. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 18:57:45 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-4958-5094

> 📌 He’d shared the spotlight this way sporadically throughout his career 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 19:08:56 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-5725-5794

> 📌 Bowie loved talking to other kinds of artists and drawing them out on pet subjects, 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 19:26:05 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-5968-6052

> 📌 Which is to say, his speaking interactions with the public after that became much more whimsical and offbeat 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 21:29:29 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-7163-7271

> 📌 What is it like to be dying? 
> ⏱ 2024-03-15 21:32:53 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-5-8455-8483

## The First Interview

> 📌 It just doesn’t grow overnight, just because the Rolling Stones did it. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 12:24:15 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-6-8251-8322

> 📌 Our Mums do it, if anything. [Laughter] 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 12:25:34 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-6-9643-9691

> ⏱ 2024-03-21 12:31:27 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-6-11149-11250

## David Bowie Tells All and More

> 📌 SALVO: It seems as even you once said, “You say most things the long way ’round.”
BOWIE: I do tend to. I’m not very articulate. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:00:07 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-2232-2447

> 📌 I used parody as a form of defense. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:03:14 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-2814-2851

> 📌 for me the most important thing to me is that the music is a communicative blanket media. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:18:08 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-4293-4382

> 📌  This “growing up before one’s time” can at times lead to any amount of various functional disorders. ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-8291-8391
- 💭 早熟 - ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:26:45 

> 📌 The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:33:44 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-9558-9644

> 📌 BOWIE: Just the general feeling that rock & roll is/was good. All of it you know—like anything, they’d take out some trite and play it. At the time you thought it was a novelty record. After two plays you got good and fed up with it. And now they play it and it’s marveled as spectacular, really great.
SALVO: Because of the nostalgia involved. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 13:39:54 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-11420-11856

> 📌 For instance, like capitalism can be all right, I mean Marx didn’t live to see what Roosevelt did with that depression. He pulled everybody out of that depressed and everybody hated Roosevelt. He got into office four times. One after the other, with everybody saying, he can’t get in again. Everybody voted for Roosevelt four times and he did a hell of a lot. Mind you, I’m a little political, not too much but I’m branching off very much here. You see I’m just getting quick flashes of what I think. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-21 18:56:48 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-17893-18450

> 📌 they want to be Americanized, a lot of them are hippies and they’re so shook up man ’cause they’ve got nothing to fight and that makes them so frustrated. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-22 10:38:37 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-21701-21855

> 📌 There’s nothing to vote for anyway and nothing’s really bad enough to bother to replace it, ’cause you can get through. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-22 10:38:56 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-22085-22261

> 📌 BOWIE: That’s why they switch from one subject to another in England all the time. One moment it’s Black Power, the next moment it’s the war in Vietnam—anything just to grab onto until it gets a bit boring because nothing actually happens. It’s like THIS SKETCH IS A BIT SILLY, LET’S GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-22 11:34:09 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-7-22453-22775

## Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman

> 📌 think the most important thing in the world is that the artists should take over this planet because they’re the only ones who can make anything happen. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-22 23:02:58 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-5359-5512

> 📌 I’m not sure whether it is me changing my mind, or whether I lie a lot. It’s somewhere between the two 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 09:17:38 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-5929-6031

> 📌 You can’t stand still on one point for your entire life. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 09:18:22 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-6179-6235

> 📌 It must affect them not just as a song, but as a lifestyle. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 15:04:32 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-11838-11898

> 📌 It would be positively boring if minds were in tune. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 16:30:36 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-13213-13266

> 📌 I was told that it was cool to fall in love, and that period was nothing like that to me. I gave too much of my time and energy to another person and they did the same to me and we started burning out against each other. And that is what is termed love … that we decide to put all our values on another person. It’s like two pedestals, each wanting to be the other pedestal. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 16:46:29 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-14273-14647

> 📌 The content of most pop lyrics is practically zero, like “Power to the People.” 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 22:00:59 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-19102-19181

> 📌 There’s a thing that just as you go to sleep, if you keep your elbows elevated that you will never go below the dream stage. And I’ve used that quite a lot and it keeps me dreaming much longer than if I just relaxed. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-23 23:28:27 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-21515-21731

> 📌 BURROUGHS: Did you see any of the porn films in New York?
BOWIE: Yes, quite a few.
BURROUGHS: When I was last back, I saw about thirty of them. I was going to be a judge at the erotic film festival. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-24 00:20:10 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-27488-27846

> 📌 People having to go out to the cinema is really archaic. I’d much rather sit at home. 
> ⏱ 2024-03-24 11:51:07 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-29273-29358

> 📌 I extended my hand and the guy retired, so I thought, “The guy doesn’t like flesh, obviously he’s reptilian.” 
> ⏱ 2024-03-24 12:12:19 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-8-31718-31828

## The Raw and Uncut Interview

> 📌 When you start singing you really have to keep smoking you know, or it all goes! 
> ⏱ 2024-03-26 12:22:16 ^CB-7KAFW2FS17SF6mx6kfEgV0av-9-13341-13422
