Abstract
1. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency.
	1. 现有的解决方案（如数据和模型并行性）在将这些模型放入有限的设备内存中，同时获得计算、通信和开发效率方面存在根本性局限性。
2. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art.
