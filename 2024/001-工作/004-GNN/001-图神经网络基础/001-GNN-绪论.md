1. Heterogeneous graphs
	1. For example, in a heterogeneous biomedical graph, there might be one type of node representing proteins, one type of representing drugs, and one type representing diseases. Edges representing “treatments” would only occur between drug nodes and disease nodes
2. Multiplex graphs
	1. Multipartite graphs are a well-known special case of heterogeneous graphs, where edges can only connect nodes that have different types
