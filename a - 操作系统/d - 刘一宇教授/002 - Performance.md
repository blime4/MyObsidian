# 002 - Performance


## Pesponse Time and Throughput

+ Response time 
	+ How long it takes to do a task 
+ Throughput 
	+ Total work done per unit time
		+ Ex:tasks/transactions/ .. per hour 

+ How are response time and throughput affected by 
	+ Replacing the processor with a faster version？
	+ Adding more processors？

+ We'll focus on response time for now


## Measuring Execution Time
+ Elapsed time 
	+ Total response time, including all aspects
		+ Processing, I/o, os overhead, idle time 
	+ Determines system performance 
	+ > 可以用来评估系统的性能
	 
+ CPU time    （[[003 - CPU time]]）
	+ Time spent processing a given job
		+ Discounts I/o time, other jobs shares 
		+ Comprises user CPU time and system CPU time 
		+ Different programs are affected differently by CPU and system performance
